# RVNE

Some future goals for this project are as follows:

## Phase I (proof of concept and architecture growing pains)

### Nodes

- [ ] Number
- [ ] Math
- [ ] Output / Result

### Sockets & Connectors

- [ ] Input sockets
- [ ] Output sockets
- [ ] Connectors

### Functionality

- [âœ…] cusotom drag n drop
- [ ] Context menu
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut for pop-up menu
- [ ] Connectors drag n drop hook up

### Push it forward

- [ ] implementations of other Nodes (possible images via SVG)

## Phase II (begin the transfer to better tools)

- [ ] move from the DOM to the canvas API
- [ ] add shapes
- [ ] add colors
- [ ] add filters

## Phase III (addition of Rust via WASM)

- [ ] build out some existing nodes in rust
- [ ] test where rust will be strongest (processing of images, not UI)

## Phase IV (deeper understanding)

- [ ] move from canvas to WebGL
- [ ] create texture creation nodes
- [ ] explore audio nodes
